# Turtle Crossing Game

This is a simple Turtle Crossing game built using Python's Turtle graphics library. The goal is to move the turtle from the bottom to the top of the screen without being hit by the moving cars.

## Features

- **Player Movement:** 
  - The player (turtle) can move up by pressing the "Up" arrow key.
  - Once the player reaches the top, they move to the next level, and the game gets faster.

- **Car Manager:**
  - Randomly generated cars move horizontally across the screen.
  - Cars increase in speed with each level.

- **Scoreboard:**
  - Displays the current level on the screen.
  - Shows a "Game Over" message when the player collides with a car.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle graphics library (pre-installed with Python)

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository** or download the code files.
2. Run the `turtle_crossing.py` script using Python:
